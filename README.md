# 🪽 Labs_Wings-Infra-Blueprints 

> **"The foundation must be solid for the wings to fly."**

This repository serves as my "Digital Bunker" for infrastructure. Here, I document my technical ascension as a Cloud Specialist, focusing on resilient architectures, automation, and governance across Multi-Cloud environments.

---

## 🟦 Mission (Philosophy)
Just as sacred geometry organizes chaos, these blueprints aim to transform complex infrastructures into scalable, secure, and efficient environments. This project reflects my progress toward mastering **Azure**, **AWS**, and **Red Hat (RHCSA/OpenShift)** ecosystems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### ☸️ Kubernetes & OpenShift (`/kubernetes`, `/openshift`)
Focused on container orchestration and workload lifecycle. Includes:
- **Core:** Pods, Deployments, and Services.
- **Resilience:** Liveness and Readiness probes to ensure the "vessel" is healthy and ready for deployment.
- **Storage:** Data persistence strategies using PVCs and StorageClasses.

### ☁️ Cloud Providers (`/azure`, `/aws`)
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for major cloud platforms:
- **Azure:** Bicep and ARM Templates for resource governance and cloud architecture.
- **AWS:** CloudFormation templates and Lambda functions (Python/Node.js).

### 🐧 Red Hat & Automation (`/scripts`)
Automation scripts and Linux engineering patterns developed for the **RHCSA** certification path.
- Critical task automation.
- System troubleshooting and performance tuning.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Bash, Python, YAML, Bicep.
- **Platforms:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenShift, Microsoft Azure, AWS.
- **Concepts:** CI/CD, IaC, GitOps, Containerization.
